  <h1>Farm Activity</h1>

  <div class="text-container">
    <p>I need to get some work done around the farm.</p>
    <p>First, I gather the hay and take it to the cow.</p>
    <p>Next, I collect eggs from the chicken coop and place them in the nearby basket.</p>
    <p>Then, one by one, I gather the pumpkins from the field and bring them to the pigs.</p>
    <p>The pigs are hungry, so they run to the pumpkins and begin to munch right away.</p>
    <p>Finally, I grab the watering can from the barn and water the garden so the vegetables can grow.</p>
    <p>All the animals are fed, and the farm is taken care of.</p>
